# numbersequences
Number sequences formatted for use with voxglitch's one-point and one-zero (VCV Rack modules)


sometimes when I'm bored I use python to generate these.

now there's also a python script to make the vcvm preset files

    python mkpresetsfromnumbersequences --seq-dir <wherever-you-cloned-this-repo-to>
